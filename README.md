# Sherpa 🐑

### Developers: Jonah, Rendy, Allen

At Sherpa, we believe trips are best experienced in stories. Sherpa is a place for you to visualize your next story. You can plan the perfect story on one platform and decide if you want to share your story as a guide to the rest of the world later on. 
#
We will have services ranging from mapping, tagging, filtering, summarizing and we pipeline our data from different high-quality rapid APIs. We bring the power of the internet to your fingertips in an all-in-one platform, so you can efficiently plan your stories and save time instead of browsing different platforms and writing badly formatted documents.
#
We are also looking to provide Machine Learning services to optimize your stories, not only giving you the optimized timeline according to weather and price data but also tracking carbon footprint and calculating optimized routes to take between tagged attractions.
